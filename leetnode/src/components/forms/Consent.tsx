          <h4>What is the purpose of this research?</h4>
          <p>
            You are invited to participate in a research study. This information
            sheet provides you with information about the research study. The
            Principal Investigator (the person in charge of this research) or
            his/her representative will also describe this research to you and
            answer all of your questions. Read the information below and ask
            questions about anything you don&apos;t understand before deciding
            whether or not to take part.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this research project, we provide an adaptive learning software
            to help students bridge their knowledge gap in electrical circuit
            principles that could hinder their performance in EE2027. We
            investigate the relationship between the mastery level they attain
            for each topic and their performance in EE1111A, EE2111A, and EE2027
            so that we can help the students better.

          <h4>Who can participate in the research?</h4>
          <p>
            What is the expected duration of my participation? What is the
            duration of this research? Only students taking EE1111A, EE2111A,
            and EE2027 can participate in the research. If you agree to take
            part, your participation will last until you successfully complete
            EE2027. The entire research project will conclude on 31 Jan 2026.

          <h4>
            What is the approximate number of research participants involved?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Three EE cohorts of about 600 students in total will be invited to
            participate in this study. The actual number of participants depend
            on the response rate.

          <h4>What will be done if I take part in this research study?</h4>
          <p>
            If you take part in this research study, we will study the
            relationship between the mastery scores you attain for each topic
            and your performance in EE1111A, EE2111A, and EE2027.

            How will my privacy and the confidentiality of my research records
            be protected?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Only the Principal Investigator knows that you have opted to
            participate in this research, and will collect your name, student
            number, and intake academic year for the purpose of studying the
            relationship between your log data (e.g., mastery scores) and your
            performance in the three modules. Your module lecturers from
            EE1111A, EE2111A, and EE2027 will not know whether you have opted to
            participate in this research. Your personal data will never be used
            in a publication or presentation. All identifiable data will be
            discarded at the end of the semester when you have completed EE2027.

        <li>
          <h4>Will there be reimbursement for participation?</h4>

          <h4>What are the possible benefits to me and to others?</h4>
          <p>
            There is no direct benefit to you. The knowledge gained would
            benefit future students taking similar modules in NUS, as well as
            other tertiary institutions around the world, as a result of any
            publication resulting from this study.

            voluntary and completely up to you. You can also withdraw from the
            research at any time without giving any reasons, by informing the
            principal investigator and all your personal data will be discarded.
